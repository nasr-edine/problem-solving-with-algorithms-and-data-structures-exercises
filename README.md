# problem-solving-with-algorithms-and-data-structures-exercises

This repository contains my solutions and experiments for programming exercises from the book **"Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures" (Release 3.0)** by Brad Miller and David Ranum.

## Structure

Exercises are organized by chapter, following the book’s progression. Each chapter has its own folder, and each exercise is a separate Python file with descriptive names.

```
01_introduction/
    ex_1_unique_letters.py
    ex_2_list_comprehension.py
    ex_3_infinite_monkey.py
    ex_3_infinite_monkey_hill_climb.py
    ex_3_infinite_monkey_greedy.py
    ex_3_infinite_monkey_genetic.py
    ...
02_algorithm_analysis/
    ...
03_basic_data_structures/
    ...

```

## Contents

- **Unique Letters & List Comprehensions:**  
  Exercises on flattening word lists and removing duplicates using loops and comprehensions.

- **Infinite Monkey Theorem Simulations:**  
  Several approaches (random, greedy, hill climbing, genetic algorithm) to simulate generating a target string by random character selection, demonstrating algorithmic strategies and performance differences.

- **More chapters coming soon!**

## How to Run

Each script is standalone and can be run with Python 3:

```sh
python ex_1_unique_letters.py
```

## About

This repo is for learning and practicing data structures, algorithms, and Python programming by working through the book’s exercises.
